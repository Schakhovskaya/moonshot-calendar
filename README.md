# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is WIP and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Moonshot Launcher
I used in this project some specific libraries, for example, for map ised react-simple-maps because with it you can see all globe. Also this library has a great documentation. 
Also I was thinking about using Redux, but after starting the project I understood that in this version of app I don't need it. 
I spent a lot of time thinking about API provided by Launch Library. I couldn't find the perfect match for my task (choose data with correct date), so I'd love to use the .filter for this task. 
Also I was thinking about the Material UI for interface, but then I remembered about Bootstrap and decided go with it. 
If I had more time, I'd add some filters on the screen with options like Company, Date start, Date end, Succesfull etc. Also I'm thinking about popups with all information about this launch. I hope next time I'll provide all of it :)
Thank you for your time!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
